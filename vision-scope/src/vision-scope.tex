\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Background}
One of the missions which the Civil Air Patrol may have to complete in the event of a serious earthquake is to survey bridge infrastructure to verify its structural integrity.  Pilots are sent on missions to fly over and photograph bridges across the state of Washington.  Currently, CAP pilots are given notebooks containing flight plans with a series of geographic coordinates.  While flying, the pilots manually key the coordinates of their next location into the cockpit navigation system.  The Flight Plan Editor software will allow CAP to generate flight plan datafiles that are compatible with the navigation system so that pilots can select them from the cockpit navigation menu, thereby relieving them of the responsibility of manualy entering location coordinates.

\subsection{Business Opportunity}
The planes in the Civil Air Patrol fleet are equipped with Garmin G1000 cockpit navigation dashboards.  This device accepts two Secure Digital flash memory cards on which flight plans are stored.  Our software will make it simple to generate and edit these flight plan data files.  This will allow CAP to create and maintain disaster response flight plans.  Existing software with the same capabilities is SkyVector.  It is slow and online-only.  Our software will run as a desktop application and be more responsive.

\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
Reduce the time spent by the pilot on navigation tasks.

Generate flight plan without internet connection.

Software has intuitive, non-cognitatively demanding interface.

Deploy flight plan data to SD card.
